# To Do List Project ðŸš€

In this project I developed a webpage with a To Do List, an input to add new items to the list, and some functions like a clear button, a save feature and the possibility to reorder the items.

Just like in the previous project, I could train my __JavaScript__, __CSS__, __HTML__ and __DOM manipulations__ skills, but this time with attention to __linter__, progressing to develop even better codes. Also, this time I was able to train my ability to manipulate the __localstorage__.
